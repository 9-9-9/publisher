* ├ static/         (v2) # ASSETS_ROOT_DIR - coockieless static subdomain to serve static assets like CSS, javaScript and images
* └ www/                 # ROOT_DIR - Publisher repository
*   ├ .htaccess          # created after running install on www.example.com/index.php
*   └ apps/              # APPS_ROOT_DIR - all apps directory
*     └ default/         # APP_ROOT_DIR - current app directory (this file's directory)

Pulisher is about to be tested on few small projects to see how it performs.
